This website is a base resume template design I found and adapted for my personal information. It is an interactive website design showcasing my skills and strengths as a potential software employee. It also provides contact information and a links to my social media as a way to get to know more about me. I fully believe that as an employee, one of my top strengths is not just that I feel I have the skills to help develop software but also the ability to work well with people in any group setting.
